Sample Input
1
6
3 1 3 2 3 2
Sample Output
2
Explanation
Here T=1 and N = 6.

Number of students having height = 3 is 3.
Number of students having height = 2 is 2.
Number of students having height = 1 is 1.

Here Mishki can choose students with height=3 () and height = 1 () , as the difference between number of students having height () and number of students having height () is maximum and greater than 0.
